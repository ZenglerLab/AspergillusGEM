# AspergillusGEM

Aspergillus species are widely used in industrial biotechnology for enzyme production and organic acid synthesis. To enhance the predictive capabilities of metabolic models for this genus, we reconstructed genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for Aspergillus nidulans, A. niger, and A. pseudoterreus. Using a highly curated draft model of A. nidulans as a template, we generated species-specific models through protein homology and performed ortholog-based refinement and manual curation. Experimental validation was conducted using high-throughput phenotyping covering 190 carbon and 95 nitrogen sources. All three models demonstrated high predictive accuracy, surpassing 80% in both carbon and nitrogen utilization tests, and outperformed remarkably previously published models in predictive performance. To further increase biological relevance, we integrated temporal transcriptomic data from A. nidulans grown with different carbon sources into the GEM, enabling 45 context-specific metabolic reconstructions. The transcriptomics-constrained models revealed dynamic shifts in pathway activities, including differential usage of central carbon metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis routes over time. Comparative analysis of predicted fluxes identified condition-specific activation of secondary metabolism and transport systems. This study provides an improved framework for modeling fungal metabolism by combining high-quality manual curation, experimental validation, and omics integration. The resulting models enhance our understanding of the metabolism of Aspergillus while offering a reliable and robust platform to guide strain engineering and optimization of biotechnological processes. The template-based modeling approach demonstrated here can be applied to other fungal species to accelerate the generation of accurate metabolic models that reflect condition-specific metabolic states.
